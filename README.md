# Calculating time taken for a Newton Raphson Method program to execute
This program calculates the time at the start of the program and at the end of it. It then subtracts both to return the time taken for the program to the run. 
The program taken is the program for calculating the root of a given function by Newton Raphson method.

In numerical analysis, Newton's method, also known as the Newton–Raphson method, named after Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The most basic version starts with a single-variable function f defined for a real variable x, the function's derivative f′, and an initial guess x0 for a root of f.
